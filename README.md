how this works:

	> run program in your terminal, it will allow you to convert from 
		> binary to decimal
		> decimal to binary
		> decimal to hex
todo:
	> change hex to bin and bin to hex so that they don't rely on other functions
	> planning to use a table to map 4 bit sets to hex equivalent, should be way faster
